      <h2>Early Life</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
    <p>I had quite humble beginnings as most artists do. Growing up in a suburb of Detroit was normal until my dad lost
      his job. That's when everything changed. I was 12 at the time, but I still knew that I needed to help my family.
      Because of this loss, we were forced to move. I had to make a new set of friends in that oh-so-awkward period of
      time known as adolescence. I needed to figure out what to do to help my family. When I started high school, I
      decided to take my school's Music Theory class, which was part of the <a href="https://esthermliu.github.io/JHSWebsite/CTE%20Program.html">CTE program</a>.

      Little did I know that would be xthe most crucial decision of my life.</p>

      <h2>Experimenting</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
    <p>After picking up the basics of music, I began experimenting with different rhythmic and melodic structures while
    trying to craft my own style. I messed around with the piano and realized that my melodies and harmonies had an
      electronic feel to them, so that would be my genre. But I was stuck doing all this by myself. I needed someone to
      share my ideas with.</p>

      <h2>Growing</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
      <p>After talking to some of my friends about this problem, they told me to talk to a couple of upcoming rappers in
      our school. However, I quickly found out that my style and structure did not suit the needs of hip hop. I decided
      something then: I would have to work on my skills and create songs all by myself. I greatly improved and started to
      publicize some of my work.</p>

      <h2>Rising to Fame</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
      <p>After putting out a couple of songs and getting fairly positive feedback from them, I decided tht I would not
      have to go to college and could branch out and gain more income without it. In September 2016, I released my most
      popular album, "Hometown", and it blew up. TArtists</p>

      <h2>Present Day</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
      <p>Now, I live in Los Angeles, California and enjoy the many fan letters I get every day. My music has gained a lot
      of attraction in LA, so I can't even step out for a quick walk without getting recognized! Alright, that's all I gotta
      say about myself. Click one of the links at the top to go to another page about my music.</p>
